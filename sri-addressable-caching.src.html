Introduction {#intro}
=====================

A substantial portion of the content downloaded by web user agents today consists
of JavaScript frameworks.  There are a relatively few frameworks which are
both extremely popular and large in size.  Many applications include these
frameworks even if they only use a small portion of the functionality they provide.

In consequence, downloading, parsing, just-in-time compiling these frameworks represents
a significant amount of the total network, battery and time budget for a modern browser.
It would be a great improvement if browsers could pre-cache
these popular libraries a single time and save much of the expense of re-fetching
them, especially for browsers that do double-keyed caching for privacy.

For example, it would be excellent if a browser could identify opportunities
when a device is idle, charging, and has unmetered network available to download,
parse and compile the most popular script files in wide use in order to increase
performance on-demand later, especially under slow network conditions.

A historical difficulty of accomplishing this has been that resources may
respond differently in different contexts, update at any time, and the same public
resource may be hosted in many locations without any way to determine without
actually fetching it whether it is actually the same content.

The `Subresource Integrity` [[SRI]] ("SRI") specification now allows for
applications to tag their script dependencies with cryptographic hashes that
strongly identify the exact content they want.  This naturally raises the
possibility of using the SRI hash to key into a content addressable cache in
the browser.

Version 1 of SRI explicitly avoided specifying a means of doing this. This
document explores why content addressable caching is difficult on the Web
platform, and how browsers might sidestep these difficulties in a non-normative
fashion.

Sharing cached resources across origins based on other signals of content identity
(such as the "immutable" value for the Cache-Control header) may have similar
privacy and security concerns and find this document useful.

Timing Leaks {#cache_timing}
============================

The first difficulty of implementing cross-origin, content addressable caching on
the Web platform is that it may leak information about the user's past browsing.
For example, site "A" could load a script with a given hash, then later when
the user visits site "B", it could attempt to observe the time it takes to load
that same resource and infer whether the user had previously been at "A".

Origin Laundering {#origin_laundering}
======================================

In general, it would seem that the use of a cryptographic hash by the requestor
to identify content to be loaded should prevent cache poisoning.  However, there
are some circumstances where the security of a script (or other content which
might be similarly identified in the future) may depend on the Origin from
which it is loaded.

`Content-Security-Policy` [[CSP3]] ("CSP") allows resources to specify from which origins
script may be loaded, as an attack surface reduction.  If 'example.com' specifies
a Content-Security-Policy of <tt>script-src 'scripts.example.com'</tt> in order to
only allow known scripts from a source it controls, it would be bad if an attacker
could inject the following into the resource:

<tt>&lt;script src="https://scripts.example.com/angular.min.js" integrity="sha-256:..." /&gt;</tt>

And by so doing force example.com to load an old version of the Angular framework
that allows bypassing of CSP, if the real https://scripts.example.com origin didn't
actually have a copy of that resource.

Similar restrictions might apply for features like Workers or ServiceWorkers which
are required to be loaded same-origin as a similar security precaution.

Suggestions for a Solution {#solution}
======================================

Because of these issues, it is difficult to specify SRI-based content addressable
caching behavior that depends entirely on the interactions between the user agent
and resources.

Luckily, browsers can do magic behind-the-scenes, and performance improvements, so
long as they are correct from the perspective of application semantics and security,
need not be precisely identical across the population of user agents.  More speed
and less resource consumption is always good.

The simple solution for timing leaks is to simply not base the population of a
content addressable cache on individual user behavior.  If loading a script is fast
because it is always fast in a given browser, there is no privacy leak.

Origin laundering is a bit more difficult to address, but it can be handled with the
same strategy that also informs population of the cache, so long as one is aware of
the issue in advance.

One possible answer to building SRI addressable caching is for user agents to enable
it for pieces of content based on large-scale content heuristics, and never
individual user behavior. Two strategies are possible: crawling and analysis of
content on the Web at large, and aggregate user browsing behavior based on browser
telemetry.  Either approach could enable a user agent to determine the most-requested
content tagged with an SRI hash and populate the browser cache in advance with these
entries.

Under such a strategy, the only information that might be leaked from timing is the
last update time of the SRI cache, and possibly the size of the storage alloted to
this type of cache. (if that is allowed to vary statically or dynamically based on
the available storage on the device)

Managing origin laundering is a bit more difficult, but only requires the cache to
be annotated with a list of the most popular sources (including path) for a given
resource and double-keying the content addressable cache with both the resource hash
and its path.  Either a crawling or user telemetry based cache population strategy
provides the necessary data for this double-keying.

In some circumstances, it may be possible to load from the content addressable
cache without using both keys, for example, if a resources Content-Security-Policy
explicitly lists the hash of an external resource as allowed in a header, that could
be interpreted as an authoritative statement that its origin provenance is irrelevant.

Nothing stops browsers from building such a cache today.  This note encourages
such experiments, while also indicating why a normative specification for doing such
may never actually emerge.
